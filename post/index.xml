      <description>I love communicating science and I am excited about the ways that data visualizations can engage scientists and non-scientist in discussion, brainstorming, and in the creation of new ideas and hypotheses. Last week in R-club (more about that later) we reviwed the Kaggle Kernel created by Martin Henze (AKA Teads or Tails) for the NY Taxi ETA Kaggle Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/nyc-taxi-eda-update-the-fast-the-curious). It was AMAZING (more reading here: http://blog.kaggle.com/2018/06/19/tales-from-my-first-year-inside-the-head-of-a-recent-kaggle-addict/). One of the packages used in this competition that I had never heard of is ‘alluvial’.</description>

      <description>This is my first time using the R &amp;lsquo;blogdown&amp;rsquo; package to create a personal website. The next few months of my life will be full of BIG changes as I transition from academia to a fellowship in Data Science. My new blogdown website will chronicle the new and exciting things I learn along the way!
Below is a photo that I took of a paraglider (one of many that we saw that day) looking down over Monte Cucco Regional Park, located along the border of Umbria and the Le Marche region in Italy.</description>
