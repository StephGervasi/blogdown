Exposure to sickness odors might also alter the physiology of healthy conspecifics and modify the odors they produce. We hypothesized that exposure to odors of sick (but non-infectious) animals would alter the odors of healthy cagemates. To induce sickness, we injected mice with a bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide. We used behavioral odor discrimination assays and analytical chemistry techniques followed by predictive classification modeling to ask about differences in volatile odorants produced by two types of healthy mice: those cohoused with healthy conspecifics and those cohoused with sick conspecifics. Mice trained in Y-maze behavioral assays to discriminate between the odors of healthy versus sick mice also discriminated between the odors of healthy mice cohoused with sick conspecifics and odors of healthy mice cohoused with healthy conspecifics. Chemical analyses paired with statistical modeling revealed a parallel phenomenon. Urine volatiles of healthy mice cohoused with sick partners were more likely to be classified as those of sick rather than healthy mice based on discriminant model predictions. Sickness-related odors could have cascading effects on neuroendocrine or immune responses of healthy conspecifics, and could affect individual behaviors, social dynamics, and pathogen spread.","tags":[],"title":"Sharing an environment with sick conspecifics alters the odors of healthy animals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["SS Gervasi et al."],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":2017,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":2017,"objectID":"0936f8d8a248d839478b720c2ec1a89c","permalink":"/publication/amphibs/2018-11-15-chytrid/","publishdate":"1969-12-31T19:33:37-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/amphibs/2018-11-15-chytrid/","section":"publication","summary":"Variation in host responses to pathogens can have cascading effects on populations and communities when some individuals or groups of individuals display disproportionate vulnerability to infection or differ in their competence to transmit infection. The fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been detected in almost 700 different amphibian species and is implicated in numerous global amphibian population declines. Identifying key hosts in the amphibian-Bd system–those who are at greatest risk or who pose the greatest risk for others–is challenging due in part to many extrinsic environmental factors driving spatiotemporal Bd distribution and context-dependent host responses to Bd in the wild. One way to improve predictive risk models and generate testable mechanistic hypotheses about vulnerability is to complement what we know about the spatial epidemiology of Bd with data collected through comparative experimental studies. We used standardized pathogen challenges to quantify amphibian survival and infection trajectories across 20 post-metamorphic North American species raised from eggs. We then incorporated trait-based models to investigate the predictive power of phylogenetic history, habitat use, and ecological and life history traits in explaining responses to Bd. True frogs (Ranidae) displayed the lowest infection intensities, whereas toads (Bufonidae) generally displayed the greatest levels of mortality after Bd exposure. Affiliation with ephemeral aquatic habitat and breadth of habitat use were strong predictors of vulnerability to and intensity of infection and several other traits including body size, lifespan, age at sexual maturity, and geographic range also appeared in top models explaining host responses to Bd. Several of the species examined are highly understudied with respect to Bd such that this study represents the first experimental susceptibility data. Combining insights gained from experimental studies with observations of landscape-level disease prevalence may help explain current and predict future pathogen dynamics in the Bd system.","tags":[],"title":"Linking ecology and epidemiology to understand predictors of mult-host responses to an emerging pathogen, the amphibian chytrid fungus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["SS Gervasi","SC Burgan","E Hofmeister","TR Unnasch","LB Martin"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":2017,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":2017,"objectID":"f5089f82f246755d7c28ab5434c9208c","permalink":"/publication/wnv/2018-11-15-stress-hormones-predict-a-host-superspreader-phenotype-in-the-west-nile-virus-system/","publishdate":"1969-12-31T19:33:37-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wnv/2018-11-15-stress-hormones-predict-a-host-superspreader-phenotype-in-the-west-nile-virus-system/","section":"publication","summary":"Glucocorticoid stress hormones, such as corticosterone (CORT), have profound effects on the behaviour and physiology of organisms, and thus have the potential to alter host competence and the contributions of individuals to population- and community-level pathogen dynamics. For example, CORT could alter the rate of contacts among hosts, pathogens and vectors through its widespread effects on host metabolism and activity levels. CORT could also affect the intensity and duration of pathogen shedding and risk of host mortality during infection. We experimentally manipulated songbird CORT, asking how CORT affected behavioural and physiological responses to a standardized West Nile virus (WNV) challenge. Although all birds became infected after exposure to the virus, only birds with elevated CORT had viral loads at or above the infectious threshold. Moreover, though the rate of mortality was faster in birds with elevated CORT compared with controls, most hosts with elevated CORT survived past the day of peak infectiousness. CORT concentrations just prior to inoculation with WNV and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations following viral exposure were predictive of individual duration of infectiousness and the ability to maintain physical performance during infection (i.e. tolerance), revealing putative biomarkers of competence. Collectively, our results suggest that glucocorticoid stress hormones could directly and indirectly mediate the spread of pathogens.","tags":[],"title":"Stress hormones predict a superspreader phenotype in the West Nile virus system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["SS Gervasi","N Burkett-Cadena","SC Burgan","AW Schrey","HK Hassan","TR Unnasch","LB Martin"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":2016,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":2016,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"1969-12-31T19:33:36-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"Stress hormones might represent a key link between individual-level infection outcome, population-level parasite transmission, and zoonotic disease risk. Although the effects of stress on immunity are well known, stress hormones could also affect host-vector interactions via modification of host behaviours or vector-feeding patterns and subsequent reproductive success. Here, we experimentally manipulated songbird stress hormones and examined subsequent feeding preferences, feeding success, and productivity of mosquito vectors in addition to defensive behaviours of hosts. Despite being more defensive, birds with elevated stress hormone concentrations were approximately twice as likely to be fed on by mosquitoes compared to control birds. Moreover, stress hormones altered the relationship between the timing of laying and clutch size in blood-fed mosquitoes.
